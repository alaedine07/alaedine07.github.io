Welcome to yet another blog on the internet.

## Why did I decide to start this blog

It all began when I came across [this blog post][after-nerd]. The author, Karim, went over a few points that really resonated with me.

### Improve your technical skills

I hate writing. I'm not good at it. I write code. I am able to take algorithms and use a programming language to describe what it is suppose to do. I find that skill does not directly translate into taking thoughts and ideas and presenting them in coherent sentences.

How does one become better at writing? As with everything else, it takes practice. I know I need to improve my writing skills, so this blog will be my practice ground.

Karim also talks about

> the old Latin principle “The best way to learn something is to teach it”.

Although a quick DuckDuckGo search did not return any results about any old Latin principles, it did return articles about [The Feynman Technique][feynman] and [The Protégé Effect][protege]. The general idea being that, teaching something requires you to have a deep and fundamental understanding of said topic.

In order for me to say that I "learned" something new, I will try my best to explain how it works in a blog post and that process will solidify my understanding of that topic.

### Market yourself

If done right, I belive this blog is a great way to market myself to potential employers. It shows initiative, leadership, my technical and writing skills.

### Learn how to write and present your ideas

This is an extension of improving on my writing skills. Being able to present your ideas in writing is a very valuable skill to have.

## Personal Motivation

One of my biggest hesitations is that eventually this will became a chore. Eventually I will run out of ideas to write about, and it becomes easier to occupy my mind with another hobby. In order to combat that, I decided to look at this blog from a different perspective. Forget about trying to decide what topics I should write about, I should use this blog as a record of all the things I've learned as a software engineer. Everytime I learn something new at work, write a blog post about it. Everytime I solve some weird problem where the answer was from StackOverflow, write a post about it.
