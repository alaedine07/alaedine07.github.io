Welcome to yet another blog on the internet.

## Why did I decide to start my own blog

why would a programmer or any IT person make a blog and spend time writing instead of investing in another thing.

### Improve my technical writing skills

I hate writing. I'm not good at it. I write code. I am able to take algorithms and use a programming language to describe what it is suppose to do. I find that skill does not directly translate into taking thoughts and ideas and presenting them in coherent sentences.

A lot of programmer are really good at writing code, but not at explaining it in a report, a documentation or peers.

How does one become better at writing? As with everything else, it takes practice. I know I need to improve my writing skills, so this blog will be my practice ground.

### Online presence

As an IT person I need to have a good online presence that will increase my chance of getting hired. It's some kind of marketing or promoting.
Many people are active on social plateforms like twitter, facebook, reedit ... but i just decided to make my own place. I think a github account, a blog and a linkedin profile are enough for me.  

### Richard Feynman

Many people think that learning is being able to remember every single line of a 600 page book, every word from a 3 hours lecture or every minute from a 10hour youtube playlist. Well some lucky people have this super power but i'm not one of them. so i decided to follow Richard Feynman technique. which I resume in **Pretend to teach it to a child** that's why I'm posting what i learn and try to explain it as simple as possible. Pretending that the reader is just a kid who stampled across my blog.

## Why using jekyll

When i first wanted to start blogging I choosed medium. but it didn't take long to decide that i really should make something that I control.
after googling i found jekyll which is a static site generator based on ruby. it's open source, well maintained by a great community, customizable, have tons of both free and paid themes and also you can deploy it with github pages. it was PERFECT !!!
